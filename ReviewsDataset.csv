mesmerized instrumental middle song got album parents christmas started lifelong love affair band yes jim morrison highly overrated yes movie extremely selfindulgent mess quite incoherent incohesive but sixties la rock scene back especially morrisons life like oh fitting adore fact oliver stones labour love one thankfully many surviving members band basically full input would take talk radio personal favourite stones throw hundred stones politically overthetop movies day when took life savings visited nine european countries including france capital paris did go eiffel tower wild romance richard linklateresque trains outstanding magic sidewalk cafes notrainwise put stupid labour strike overnight sleeper car berne switzerland paris switched middle night four times could prove point and see morrisons grave met fantastic people made pilgrimage world first time red wine smoking pot the graffiti sculpture pere lachaise cemetery fascinating life would go of course would its val kilmers best work mile the film oozes charisma breathes lifejust bands work must done back day worth purchase rewatches watch year jims birthday accidentally bought twice fan music culture bonafide classic stone actually really something hypnotic film emphasizes negative side jim morrison filled fabrications released in directed oliver stone chronicles southern california band the doors rise fall the film focuses charismatic singer jim morrison val kilmer falls alcoholism drugaddiction he flew france march join girlfriend pamela courson meg ryan pursue different career died next summer due ongoing substance abuse the band members played kyle maclachlan ray manzarek frank whaley robby krieger kevin dillon john densmore im old enough remember the doors the first time heard older brother asked knew busted laughing saying the doors why dont call the window sills yeah thought name pretty lame discovered morrisons reasoning behind there known and unknown in doors another thing respect song used opening alltime favorite film original version redux after bought best of album impression sound horribly dated even then over time however ive come respect the doors music unique they dont sound like anyone else they weird moody vibe even augmented strange carnival feel over top morrisons commanding haunting vox prefer artistic songs like riders storm the end opposed hits deny catchiness light my fire goofy charm people strange the film focuses jim morrison leaves viewer impression miserable artisticgenius type sense moderation sought escape personal struggle loose sex substance misuse rock roll his excessive selfabuse eventually spilled closest ultimately landed premature grave his body lies paris mecca fans spraypainted surrounding monuments gaudy graffiti profane the image leaves jim morrison fun around even death so pretty much ultimate story sex drugs rock roll stone said based view morrison depicted film transcripts people actually knew around band from documents emerged central truth morrisons final years image wild excess because left bad impression man felt morrison spacedout immature jerk abusive others foolishly sacrificing life talents altar alcohol drug idolatry yet part truth thankfully documentary extras disc the road excess balances things one morrisons sweethearts wiccan patricia kennealy played kathleen quinlan movie guitarist another guy offer side story they properly point stones film shows jims wild crazy side emphasizing events depicted picture sometimes true arent happened they unanimously describe morrison genuine innocent shy loving gallant amazing person made around feel important best friend robby even states jim influential person ive ever met in addition documentary features numerous clips morrison clearly showing funloving nice sane person rather spacedout abusedriven dude shown film needless say documentary helps roundout ones image man bottom line val kilmer doesnt play jim morrison is jim morrison this small feat vital film light fact appears practically every frame he award in case youre mood something captures counterculture vibe worth checking tends exaggerate things name mythmaking usually case movies for instance jim never lit closet door pamela locked inside rolling eyes idiotic thanksgiving dinner sequence never happened naked revelries concerts bonfire overblown fabrications still mesmerizing spacedout way highlighted the doors music throughout unfortunately first half superior second half becomes unpleasant offering limited unflattering impression morrison thats essential also watch the road excess bonus disc better yet excellent documentary doors when exclusively uses footage photos another problem movie loses dramatic pull second half preference hypnotic yet chaotic visual mayhem mention outright lies lastly road oliver stone makes couple really asinine statements commenting morrison states to live life intensely well die young achieve everlasting fame glory greatest its achilles alexander jim morrison huh another dubious line the road excess leads palace wisdom is drugs jims road excess led straight early grave enlightenment the film runs hours minutes grade the road excess documentary gets ab not enough credit actually given great piece filmmaking oliver stone finest acting performances highest degree kilmer supberb jim morrison arguably meg ryans best performance great cameos movie tooincluding billy idol kyle maclachlan great ray manzarek michael madsen also appears loved show is everybody in

519,6,clearly team behind expected least make reasonable profit seriously doubt anyone involved making film even considered possibility becoming cult classic today victor miller wrote story openly admitted riding success halloween the late actress betsy palmer even claimed reading script thought story trash actually used another word took job needed new car little know took role character would immortalize one biggest horror icons times yes evident victor miller don mancini capitalized success halloween truth manages stand end two slasher films killer prowls around murdering teenagers two films really much common to day john considered horror film lack better word remains classic still seen less underappreciated respectable flick why probably even though absolutely love admit certainly campy nature pun intended in case mind campiness actually enjoy in story begins summer camp named camp crystal lake we see two young camp counselors sex someone appears nowhere murders we get see killer since murders shown pointofview shot reason behind murders yet explained either the story jumps focuses alice young sensible girl along kids age hired counselor man attempts reopen camp crystal lake unfortunately someone seem thrilled reopening place lead series gruesome murders could person killed two counselors back in end alice come face face killer fight life spoilers ahead plotwise may remarkable really need either could wrong believe film first introduced formula consists summer camp scenario pinch mystery plentiful gore creative deaths gratifying reveal towards last minutes just like film attempted ride success previous slasher ironically ended generating bunch arguably inferior clones well of course commercial success necessarily imply quality think certain something makes appealing lot people for part characters film seem somewhat generic one dimensional common attribute slasher films there really much character development get know well most victims young boys girls seem camp good time rather working hard make children happy surely characters really deserve die immature silly time hard feel bad either however first character gets killed timejump seems genuinely sweet caring one obviously feels bad brutally murdered naïve enough trust stranger think death timejump perfect move sets tone perfectly going happen later bunch innocent young people brutally murdered without done anything deserve the acting mostly plain cases top along silly dialogs lines provides film enjoyable campy nature the late betsy palmer played role mrs pamela voorhees nominated razzie award love character mrs voorhees felt bad hear passing understand nominated true portrayal mother top appear unintentionally funny delivery lines time sure imagine character played differently point then crazy ralph literally jumping closet telling kids leave doomed camp crystal lake death curse this character aside called ralph case anyone notice crazy first place perhaps one campiest characters slasher subgenre earned iconic place franchise even small part first sequel offers nice variety gory murders tom savini charge makeup effects undeniable seal quality the legendary death scene perhaps one memorable parts film many fans in scene sean cunningham tom savini offer morbidly satisfying shocking onscreen death also get lot tension suspense preceding murder creates feeling panic desperation the final confrontation alice final girl mrs voorhees vengeful mother really extensive good cause helps build lot tension culminates gruesome murder to extent mrs voorhees suddenly appears nowhere begins tell story happened easy assume responsible carnage least involved certain degree up point never seen throughout entire film popping there supporting characters left blame murders mrs voorhees shows exact moment things got really ugly what could camp crystal lake middle night murdering boys girls of course final girl even though unintelligent seems somewhat oblivious really happening makes want scream mrs voorhees basically explaining whole story audience time subtly revealing killer going weird trance starts talking possessed jason son drowned lake always considered like switched version norman bates mother as mentioned acting final confrontation exactly brilliant audience ends getting probably needed understand story since mrs monologue basically goes detail happened make sure get right like make sure understand ralph crazy old man calling regardless top acting spoonfeeding audience confrontation full tension still considered one memorable moments history horror good reason some films benefit time maturing holding nostalgic charm others rot like bad apple like friday perhaps alive actually appreciate one really groundbreaking people like think rather another spin films like psycho halloween minus budget and acting certainly first slasher movie arguably influential this original film stands alongside part new beginning two movies film long franchise play killer mystery think premise would wear thin tried every go around executed masterfully least films benefit friday movie ill watch least year ever since first saw early maybe best movie

never wrote maybe go directors filmography hisher next big movie ill also try review previous films inside franchise example liveaction mulan released ill definitely rewatch review original you get point the untouchables one classics ive already seen times cant quite recall last time watched almost felt like whole new release since didnt remember plot points really enjoyed experiencing great period gangster movie the cast incredible ill get need start impressive production level flick from set design wellcrafted action sequences everything looks feels like chicago prohibition era love dialogues played nowadays common entire film filled long uncut conversations characters most directors employ unimaginative linecutline type dialogue im biggest fan brian depalma even though started one favorite action sagas alltime mission impossible however blockingframing skills outstanding movie every actors movement followed seamlessly camera dp stephen burum making every single shot count the screenplay wellstructured every time film starts lacking energy something impactful occurs great action scene new story development changes course narrative characters decision makes viewer worried inevitable outcome consequently the untouchables rarely loses momentum always entertaining shape form the four characters constitute title group emotionally compelling actors offer extraordinary performances except lead kevin costner dont know people might consider hot take find costners display extremely onedimensional during movie goes lifethreatening situations people cares die eventually gets facetoface al capone his facial expression looks awkwardly almost identical scenes many its first big film one catapulted stardom im first find acting rangeless flick nevertheless doesnt become big distraction cant connect character regarding rest cast sean connery steals show portrayal jim malone hes charming funny needs take character dark dramatic scene problems delivering exceptional performance the young andy garcia george stone proves chops become great actor charles martin smith surprisingly witty oscar wallace my main issue movie involves lack screentime given robert de niro al capone sure story people got famous gangster biography latter however waste phenomenal actor also waste potentially great character al capone supposedly quite clever businessman ruthless crime boss possessing unusually wellprotected organization appears scattered scenes like hes random villain good guys need defeat granted theyre really cool scenes doesnt feel like massive threat film assumes since viewer barely gets know al capone holds much power all the untouchables still holds incredibly well thirty years productionwise sets costumes seamlessly resemble prohibition era brian depalmas technically impressive blocking framing joy watch long captivating uncut dialogues elevated remarkable cast sean connery undoubtedly standout despite kevin costner lacking bit emotional range even action sequences movie look better lot blockbusters today david mamet writes wellstructured screenplay rarely loses interest featuring exceptionally compelling characters addictive score ennio morricone well however robert de niro character al capone underused especially latter for important character constantly changes path narrative lack screentime doesnt allow viewer understand al capones motivations feel much threat truly still classic worthy rewatch definitely recommend rating

910,7,et us get right away think johnny depp right person playing ichabod crane maybe influenced seeing pirates the caribbean think right person role he really work he whimsical gesticulating taken seriously scientifically inclined crime investigator far concerned too bad since story movie quite promising as often case tim work movie quite dark tone quite like the various scruffy suspicious characters ichabod meets right away enters village inn fits right eerie atmosphere unfortunately inclination science clashes rest story undoubtedly supernatural it makes movie really distinct direction instead waddle one foot camp would preferred movie either gone science end ichabod exposed evil perfectly human adversary scientific means gone supernatural ichabod adept exposing exorcising supernatural beings rather scientist having said movie still decent enough evening flick fairly enjoyable the footage scenery well done one would expect tim burton it exactly special effects loaded movie fairly okay least movie it ichabod crane put test sleepy hollow directed tim burton coadapted screenplay andrew kevin walker kevin yagher the legend sleepy hollow written washington irving it stars johnny depp christina ricci miranda richardson marc pickering michael gambon jeffrey jones casper van dien music scored danny elfman cinematography emmanuel lubezki new york ichabod crane timid forward thinking detective sent way village sleepy hollow investigate number decapitations perfect match director actor source material sleepy hollow unfolds fun filled creeper visual aural pleasures wonder nobody thought put combination together earlier story familiar though changes although comedy ends bit sillier tonally appropriate really ichabod stop pushing effeminate angle breaking point film runs along fair old clip never wants period devilment its never really scary walkens headless horseman isnt part scene unlikely burton depp aiming soil underwear anyway more case charming whilst caressing tingler spine case style substance yes degree source story still comes lavish eye candy painting reveal proudly burton created world gothic mysticism blend hammer horror values brothers

foreboding rumbles costuming first rate colleen atwood lubezkis colour lensing rick heinrichs production design the cast led superbly depp appear pitching performances right tone directors want although ricci sadly underused key role could done richardson since wonderfully catty yummy equal measure but bona fide thespian quality support ranks joining gambon jones michael gough ian mcdiarmid richard griffiths picture never falls short scene enhancers period peril glint eye sleepy hollow delightful nights entertainment fire decent watch might watch recommend while johnny depp christina ricci carry quite bit movie quite lot else going the horseman tend dominate much story original dont feel much original fable headless horseman pretty much take seems fine though maybe easter bunny version would push boundaries this weird create weird atmosphere add depp weirder stuff weird people handle despite believing ghosts fights ichabod crane smart cowardly constable interesting literally hero role painted this surprisingly mystery type movie the action usually intense brief happens much movie spent looking rational explanations ocoms razor wins this good movie decent mystery feel awkward many cases people board expect headless horsemen mystery fans enjoy though great spooky flick fall season sleepy hollow tim burtons stylish take washington irvings classic tale ichabod crane headless horseman starring johnny depp crane christopher walken hessian horseman the story set involves crane constable new york city going dutch hamlet sleepy hollow investigate series gruesome murders victims decapitated whether like burtons films deny talent visuals overall production this guy knows make film look good thats sure as depp portrays sleuth ichabod human manner eg hes afraid spiders amusingly passes occasion there four things really impress picture besides depp love spooky fall atmosphere obviously takes place sometime gloomy november always thought concept headless horseman insipid sleepy hollow depicts horrificsupernatural fashion hes actually scary mention skilled weaponry virtually unstoppable wouldnt want run dark alley anywhere else matter miranda richardson almost time filming man gorgeous nuff said christina ricci also looks great claire skinner small role sleepy hollow lacks goofy vibe burtons films possess material presented respectable generally serious manner albeit ultraserious say hammer horror speaking sleepy hollow strikes modern hammer film anything else perhaps thats burton gave christopher lee cameo needless say love hammer doesnt youll appreciate sleepy hollow the last half hour packed action attention starts wandering dont worry picks big time the plots whodunit gets kinda convoluted youll need pay attention rewatch not have sleepy hollow cinematic feast enjoy even complications plot lose theres nothing else say except reemphasize sleepy hollow definitely ideal spooky flick autumn time really the film runs
